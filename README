AxKit::XSP::CharsetConv - AxKit XSP taglib for charset conversion


The XSP CharsetConv taglib implements character set conversion as
implemented in iconv(), through the Apache::AxKit::CharsetConv module
that comes with your standard AxKit install. You may wish to use it
to convert data from misc. sources (databases, files, browser posts,
the environment, etc...) that are not UTF-8 yet need to be included in
the output of your XSP.
